👉 I'm **Akram**, a `Software Engineer` and `Machine Learning Engineer` who enjoy building
some crazy projects and constantly pushing my limits.

## Tech Stack

👉 Most of my projects are built using :

- `Java`

- `Python`

- `C`

⁂ Why ? Because why not :p

## Currently Working on

👉 Here are the projects I’m actively developing and iterating on:

-  **Software Engineering Projects**
  - **Grammify** — a grammar error correction tool
  - **Onx Language** — a custom programming language (it's pronounced "Phoenix" btw)
